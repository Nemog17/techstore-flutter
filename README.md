# TechStore Flutter App

This repository contains a simplified Flutter application that demonstrates the basic structure of an online store for computer components. It includes a user catalog, product details, cart management and a minimal admin panel.

## Features

- **GoRouter** based navigation
- **Riverpod** for state management
- Basic authentication distinguishing normal users and admins
- Placeholder API service using the `http` package
- Separate screens for catalog, product details, cart, payment and administration

The app is not fully functional but serves as a starting point for further development.
